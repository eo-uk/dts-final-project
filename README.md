# dts-final-project

## Description
This is a prototype built for the Major DTS Applied Research Project module. The purpose of this prototype is to demonstrate the use of a web component library built with Lit across multiple web frameworks.

As a more concrete example, the shared web components in this repository have built-in accessibility features to ensure certain accessibility standards are met.

Each example application in this repository has two views. One is a simple contact form built with the shared web components, the other is a control page that has the same contact form but without the use of the shared web components.

## Usage
Run the below command in any of the app folders to install the shared components library.
```
npm install ../web-components
```

## Versions
- lit: 3.1.0
- express: 4.18.2
- next: 14.0.4
- nuxt: 3.9.3
- svelte: 4.2.7
